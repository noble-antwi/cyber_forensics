Upon confiscation of the laptop

 As the Digital Forensics specialist working at the Cyber Crimes Division (CCD) of Boston Police Department, I have been tasked to conduct a Forensics examination of the Hard Drive in the Laptop to ascertain whether the accusations levelled against Beverly Gate are true and merited or just one that does not hold any water. Receiving the evidence from the Police Officer assigned to the case, we have to follow Due Process in Filling the Chain of Custody Form.the chain of custody process will determine whether evidence may be considered admissible in court. Without following chain of custody and producing the appropriate documentation to support it, the opposing attorney can challenge or dismiss the evidence presented. It is crucical to Fill the Chain of custody form as it perfectly alignes with Daubert standard. 
This standard is used by a trial judge to make a preliminary assessment of whether an expert’s scientific testimony is based on reasoning or methodology that is scientifically valid and can properly be applied to the facts at issue. Under this standard, the following factors may be considered in determining whether the methodology is valid:



Has the theory or technique in question been tested?


Has the theory or technique been subjected to peer review and publication?


Does the theory or technique have any known or potential errors?


Does the theory or technique adhere to the maintenance of standards controlling its operation?


Has the theory or technique attracted widespread acceptance within a relevant scientific community?


Established in 1993 as a result of the Supreme Court case Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (509 U.S. 579), the Daubert standard is the test currently used in federal and most state courts. Because the Daubert standard requires that scientific evidence presented in court be generally accepted in the field, it is unlikely that new tools would be immediately approved for use in court. For this reason, it is important that a forensic investigator be familiar with emerging technologies and developments in the field of forensic techniques.

CARRYING OUT THE FORENSICS.
Me, Noble Worlanyo Antwi, as the Digital Forensics specialist working at the Cyber Crimes Division (CCD) of Boston Police Department, I will be making use of three main Forensics Analysis tools to come to a conclusion as to whether the crime has indeed been perprated or its just a lie. The tools are
1. FTK Imager
2. Autopsy
3. Paraben's Electronic Evidence Examiner(E3)

All these three software's have been installed on my workstation running a Microsoft Server 2019 Edition. The image file of the Hard Drive from the Suspect, Beverly Gate has already been taken and stored on Drive C. We will later check the intergrity of the image file using the command line version of FTK imager to generate the Hash Values and do the comparism.

To initiat the process, I created a folder on the desktop called 10001-BPD-CCD, indicating the name of the case or the case number in order to order everything in a right manner
